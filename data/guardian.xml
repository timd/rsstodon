<title>How the autumn statement brought back the ‘squeezed middle’</title>

<description><p>IFS and Resolution Foundation say Jeremy Hunt’s policies will shock middle England, with higher taxes here to stay</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/british-people-poorer-ifs-uk-autumn-statement">The British people ‘just got a lot poorer’, says IFS</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business">Autumn statement 2022: all our coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p>Traditionally, elections in Britain are decided by swing voters in a relatively small number of seats. Parties go to considerable lengths to tailor their policies to the perceived demands of those getting by on average incomes. Pollsters have even coined names for the archetypal electors that need to be wooed: Basildon man and Worcester woman.</p><p>So it will be of some concern to government strategists that the post-autumn statement analysis by thinktanks focused heavily on how the measures announced by Jeremy Hunt would have an effect on those not particularly poor but not especially rich either. The Resolution Foundation and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/british-people-poorer-ifs-uk-autumn-statement">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> each highlighted the return of the “squeezed middle”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/how-the-autumn-statement-brought-back-the-squeezed-middle">Continue reading...</a></description>

<title>‘I can’t see any light at the end of the tunnel’ – a family reacts to the autumn statement</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/19/i-cant-see-any-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-a-family-reacts-to-the-autumn-statement</link>
<description><p>The Burns family is still recovering from Covid’s financial fallout but now higher bills and rising taxes are hurting too</p><p>“We want it to get better, we want some light,” says Alison Burns. Her family is feeling the financial pain caused by Covid and now the cost of living crisis. “But while the government keeps throwing everything at us, I can’t see any light at the end of the tunnel. How is any of this going to be made better?”</p><p>Burns, who lives with her husband, Steven, and two children, Lewis and Alice, in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, says money is tight. “Like a lot of people our finances haven’t recovered from Covid and all these budgets have hurt each and every way,” she says. “It is people who are working and on the breadline that are suffering the most.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/19/i-cant-see-any-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-a-family-reacts-to-the-autumn-statement">Continue reading...</a></description>

<title>The Guardian view on tax rises: a necessary change | Editorial</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/18/the-guardian-view-on-tax-rises-a-necessary-change</link>
<description><p>No one likes having to pay more, but hard times and Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement have put the issue at the centre of politics</p><p>Elections hinge on the people in the middle. The same goes for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/18/jeremy-hunt-faces-rebellion-on-tory-right-over-autumn-statement" title="">Jeremy Hunt’s</a> autumn economic statement this week. In the space between the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-delivers-plan-for-stability-growth-and-public-services" title="">statement’s</a> modest increases in personal taxes on the richest on the one hand, and its increased support for the poorest on the other, Thursday’s package was marked by a major revenue-raising squeeze on the living standards of the many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/how-the-autumn-statement-brought-back-the-squeezed-middle" title="">millions in the middle</a>. This represents one of the biggest political gambles by any government in modern times, the more so because this is the same government that helped create the very problem it is now struggling to solve.</p><p>This large group of taxpayers and voters has gone by many aliases down the years – among them Middle Britain, the squeezed middle and the just-about-managing. Not everyone who falls into any of these categories thinks of themselves in the same ways, and there are certainly many large contrasts of wealth and living standards among them. In personal finance terms, they stretch all the way from anyone who will now miss out on the more targeted cost of living support for their heating costs from April, through to those whose incomes will be dragged into higher tax bands in the coming years as a result of the freezes on allowances.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<description><p>Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the British people had 'just got a whole lot poorer', during a livestream in which his thinktank shared its analysis on the autumn statement and broader economic climate. Explaining the scope of the burden this would place on the public, Johnson said we have entered a new high tax, large state era.

<title>Hunt’s plan may please the markets, but austerity without real growth would be fatal | Mohamed El-Erian</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/18/jeremy-hunt-markets-austerity-growth-recovery-productivity-green-trading</link>
<description><p>There will be no recovery unless the chancellor addresses low productivity, the green economy and trading relations post Brexit </p><p>Jeremy Hunt won’t enjoy today’s papers. “Tories soak the strivers,” agonises the Mail, the condemnation bolstered by a columnist’s lament: “And there was me thinking we’d voted in the Conservatives”. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/18/uk-newspaper-front-pages-today-what-the-papers-say-jeremy-hunt-autumn-statement">From bad to worse</a>,” says the Guardian. “Hunt paves the way for years of pain,” says the Financial Times. “Carnage,” predicts the Mirror. “Years of tax pain,” warns the Times.</p><p>But then his autumn statement was never going to be easy or please everybody. It had to meet multiple objectives, some of which are contradictory in the short term; it was positioned to pursue a total fiscal effort that is greater than what I believe is strictly necessary, and it had to reconcile economic and financial realities with political and institutional priorities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/18/jeremy-hunt-markets-austerity-growth-recovery-productivity-green-trading">Continue reading...</a></description>

<description><p>The Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's spending watchdog, says that living standards will fall by 7%, wiping out eight years' worth of growth as the country falls into a recession. The OBR's chief, Richard Hughes, says that government schemes to cap household energy bills will not stop the drop in living standards, and that the huge increase in energy prices leaves the UK 'poorer'</p><ul><li>Worst fall in UK living standards since records began, says OBR</li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2022/nov/17/obr-says-uks-living-standards-to-fall-by-7-video">Continue reading...</a></description>

This blog is now closed</p><p>In the Commons <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> is making a statement about the G20 summit. These statements are normally routine, and just summarise what was said or decided at the meeting. They don’t normally include fresh announcements.</p><p>Sunak started by talking about the missile incident in Poland. He said Russia attacked Ukraine with missiles on the day that he “confronted the Russian foreign minister across the G20 summit table”. He said the blame for the missile landing in Poland lay with Russia. Ukraine could not be blamed for defending itself, he said.</p><p>During the bombardment of Ukraine on Tuesday an explosion took place in eastern Poland. The investigation into this incident is ongoing and it has our full support.</p><p>As we’ve heard the Polish and American presidents say, it is possible the explosion was caused by Ukrainian munition which was deployed in self-defence.</p><p>In just a few moments the chancellor will build on these international foundations when he sets out the autumn statement, putting our economy back on to a positive trajectory and restoring our fiscal sustainability.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-live-jeremy-hunt-to-unveil-budget-plans-as-labour-says-12-years-of-tory-economic-failure-holding-uk-back-rishi-sunak-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a></description>
